# Kigali Spotter
this is the backend side of the Kigali Spotter project web

 Kigali Spotter is a City Guide system that helps users spot and discover hidden gems and unique experiences in Kigali, offering a fresh perspective on the city's offerings.


## Problem Statement:
Many travellers need help finding reliable and up-to-date information about a city's attractions, restaurants, hotels, and shops. Existing resources may require more user-generated reviews and comprehensive listings, leading to frustration and time-consuming research for travellers.


### How It Works:
Users visit the website and are greeted with a user-friendly interface showcasing categories such as attractions, restaurants, hotels, and shops.

They can browse listings within each category, view detailed information, including addresses, contact details, and reviews, and use search and filtering options to find specific listings.

Users can leave reviews and ratings for listings based on their experiences, helping fellow travellers make informed decisions.

Social media integration allows users to share their favourite listings with friends and followers, increasing the directory's visibility and engagement.
